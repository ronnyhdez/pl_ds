# Creating a pl.DataFrame

```{python}
import polars as pl
```

```{python}
scratch_df = pl.DataFrame({
    "customer_id" : [1,2,3],
        "first_name" : ["dan", "jan", "tan"],
    "last_name" : ["hanson", "manson", "tanson"]
})
```

```{python}
display(scratch_df)
```

Or

```{python}
print(scratch_df)
```

Which is the same.

## Reading from csv

```{python}

```
